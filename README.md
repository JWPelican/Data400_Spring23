# # The Effects of Racial Demographics on Online Reviews

## Abstract

In this repository one will find the culmination of data collection and analysis of businesses within the city of Philadelphia. The goal of this project is to determine if the racial demographics of the neighborhood in which a business is located have any noticable impact on the reviews it recieves online. In this particular case we will be looking at reviews found on the popular online website Yelp.
## Usage

All files within this repository should be able to be open using in browser or pre installed viewing software. For better user experience or easier exploration of the data, it is reccomended that files be opened in QGIS and Google Sheets.

## Roadmap

This project is by no means fully complete, but stands to serve as a baseline for which further research can be done. Going forward the creator plans to examine the effect of other demographic data, including but not limited to: average income, neighborhood incorporation date, and staff salary. Future goals also include collecting data from other online review sources, primarily Google Reviews, to provide a more detailed examination into the effects that bias have on online reviews.
